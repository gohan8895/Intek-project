# Diagonal Difference

## Description

- This code for those who would like to calculate the absolute difference between the sums of matrix diagonals.
- Param matrix: a Python array representing a n-by-n square matrix such
    as for instance::

        [[0, 1, 2, 3],
        [5, 6, 7, 8],
        [9, 8, 7, 6],
        [5, 4, 3, 2]]
- Return: an integer representing the absolute diagonal difference of the specified matrix.

## Installation and running

- Python3 installation is required to get started (check by using python3 --version)
- Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/intek-training-jsc/intek-mission-password_format-hoaithu1.git`

- Import diagonal_difference and test as below instruction:

```python
>>> matrix1 = [
... [0, 1, 2, 3],
... [5, 6, 7, 8],
... [9, 8, 7, 6],
... [5, 4, 3, 2]]
>>> calculate_diagonal_difference(matrix1)
8
```
It return an integer representing the absolute diagonal difference.
In this case: The left-to-right diagonal is equal to `0 + 6 + 7 + 2 = 15`. The right-to-left diagonal is equal to `3 + 8 + 5 + 7 = 23`. Their absolute difference is `|23 - 15| = 8.`
